# Data Ingestion Pipeline  
(06016415 Functional Programming  – School of Information Technology, KMITL)

## Overview
This project serves as an example of a **data ingestion pipeline**
designed and implemented using **Functional Programming (FP) principles in Scala**.

The purpose of this project is **not merely to ingest data**,
but to demonstrate how core concepts taught in the *Functional Programming* course—such as
**pure functions**, **immutability**, and **function composition**—can be applied
to real-world data engineering problems.

Through this project, students are expected to focus on
**designing data pipelines as composable, testable, and reasoning-friendly systems**
rather than on framework-specific implementations.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Dr. Issarapong Khuankrue**
for his guidance and for providing me with the opportunity
to contribute to the teaching and learning activities
of this Functional Programming course.
